# Netflix Movies & TV Shows

## Description
In this project, I analyzed a dataset that contains movies and TV shows that are available on Netflix.  The dataset, which was pulled from the Kaggle website, can be found here.  There are several questions I sought to answer with this dataset:

**Overview**
1. Change in number of shows/movies available over time.
2. Proportion of shows vs movies.
3. Number of directors, cast members, countries available, and genres.
4. Average lengths for movies and tenure for shows.
5. Most and least common countries, genres, ratings, directors, and cast members.

**Deep Dive**

6. Length of cast by country.
7. Proportion of shows vs movies by country.
8. Range of directors in terms of number of countries.
9. Average movie length by genre and country.
10. TV show tenure by genre.
11. How the content in different regions compares to one another.

**Natural Language Processing**

12. Most common words in descriptions overall and by genre.


## Files
I split my analysis into the following notebooks:
- [Netflix_EDA](https://github.com/albert-ntiri/netflix2/blob/main/Netflix_EDA.ipynb): This notebook contains the initial data clean up steps and answers questions 1-5.
- [Netflix_Deep_Dive](https://github.com/albert-ntiri/netflix2/blob/main/Netflix_Deep_Dive.ipynb): This notebook answers the deep dive questions 6-10 and 12.
- [Netflix_Region_Comparison](https://github.com/albert-ntiri/netflix2/blob/main/Netflix_Region_Comparison.ipynb): This notebook uses object-oriented programming to generate a set of metrics by region to answer question 11.
